<!--The for attribute in HTML is used to associate a <label> element with a form control, such as an <input> element. 
    This attribute helps improve accessibility and usability by allowing users to click on the label to focus or activate 
    the associated input field.
    he value of the for attribute must match the id of the form control it is associated with.
When the label is clicked, the browser automatically focuses on or activates the form control linked via the for attribute.-->
